    <h1>What is different about SpaceX?</h1>
    <p>Well, SpaceX is a privately owned company founded by Elon Musk, the highly revered private space entrepreneur.
        NASA, on the other hand, is a government-owned and funded organization. ... And the company launches both
        commercial and military satellites for its clients. So, that's the difference between SpaceX and NASA.</p>

    <p>While there are no public tours of SpaceX available, the Starship building site can be seen from Boca Chica and
        if you're lucky enough to be in South Padre Island at the right time, you could even witness the next launch
        attempt in the comfort of your beachfront vacation rental.</p>
